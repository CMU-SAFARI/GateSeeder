= Week 13

== TO DO

* Variable read length
* Finish encoding

== Achievements

* `indexdna` updated for partitioning + log info about the index & locations
* FPGA implementation for variable length
* CPU implementation for variable length
* Encoding for variable and constant length (4 bits encoding + bit packing)
* Tests on the Pacbio dataset

== Results

=== Encoding

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|`A` | 0x0
|`C` | 0x1

|`G` | 0x2
|`T` | 0x3

|`N` | 0x4
|`END OF READ` (only for variable length) | 0xf
|===

== Questions

* Which parameters for long reads (Pacbio: 10kb - 20kb)?
* Semester project report?
