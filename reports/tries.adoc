= Tries

== Create a raw index

=== Pros

* Don't need to create buckets and scales well when k increases
* Easy to generate

=== Cons

* Long access time (Dichotomic search: _O(log(n))_ (with _n â‰ƒ 6E8_) to get one triplet)
* Is not 32 bit aligned

== Put minimizers in the same bucket

* Since we are using a hash function with avalanche effect, the number of false positive doesn't increase that much.
* Helps to reduce the size of the minimizer array and still use large values for k.

== Replace the less significant bit of the location by the strand
