= Week 4

== TO DO

* Understand why there are true negatives and try to delete them
* Implement different sort algorithm
* Start implementation on Vitis-HLS

== Achievements

* True negatives bug fixed
* Corrected the sketch function of _minimap2_
* Rewrote the sketch function for synthesis

== Results

=== True negatives bug fixed

Info: Reads file: res/ERR240727_1.fastq read
Info: Number of true positives 5338322 (99.995636%)
Info: Average mapping quality of the true positives 29
Info: Number of true negatives 36 (0.004363%)
Info: Average mapping quality of the true negatives 1

Info: Number of found locations 78009321
Info: Percentage of matching locations compared to the found locations 6.832608%

The remaining true negatives correspond to the filtered minimizers.

== Questions
* Input stream, each base on 3 bits (A, T, C, G, N)?
* Or each base on 2 bits, and we delete the Ns from the reads (in this case more minimizers);
