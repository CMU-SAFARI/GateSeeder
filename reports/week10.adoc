= Week 10

== TO DO

* Generate the Bitstream
* Implement the host program
* Check the performances of TaPaSCo
* Finish the CPU implementation

== Achievements

* CPU implementation done
* IP generated for the FPGA version
* According to the Tapasco documentation, the tool only provides a poor support for HBM

== Results

.4093747 reads, 100 bases, full DNA, k18, w12, f2000, b26, min_t3, loc_r150, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1

== Questions

* Do I need to use Vivado block diagram for HBM?
* HBM stack -> 4 GB, enough to store the index, I can connect 8 kernels (2 AXI interfaces per kernel) to 1 HBM stack
