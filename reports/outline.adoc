= Outline

== Introduction

* Read mapping
* Indexing & seeding
* Memory bottleneck
* Processing near memory
* cf. Proposal

== Background
* k-mer, minimizer
* seeding algorithm
* FPGA & HBM

== Implementation
=== Reference genome indexing
* Constrains:
** reduce the number of memory accesses
** contiguous memory accesses
** size of the human DNA
** filtering
* Construction of the hash table
* specificities of the CPU index
* specificities of the FPGA index
** partitioning for HBM

=== Read encoding
** 4-bit encoding and bit-packing
** Constant length vs Variable length

=== Choice of Parameters
* Size of the buffers
* Adjacency test

=== Cpu implementation
* Multi thread CPU implementation
** Constant length vs Variable length

=== FPGA implementation
* Pipeline
* Data flow
* HBM
* Tapasco

== Results
* Performances of the CPU implementation
** Scaling?
** Comparison with minimap2
* Estimation of the performances of the FPGA implementation

== Future work

== Conclusion
