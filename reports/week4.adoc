= Week 4

== TO DO

* Implementation of the sensitivity test
* Execute the sensitivity test on reads extracted from the reference genome
* Execute the sensitivity test on *modified* (using pbsim) reads extracted from the reference genome.
* Execute the sensitivity test on read samples and compare the result with _minimap2_
* Find the optimal size for the buffers

== Achievements

* parsing FASTQ and PAF files
* Query the hash-table and get the possible locations for a given read
* Sensitivity test with several inputs
* Compare the results with _minimap2_ and log interesting data

== Questions

* Skip the strand (reduce the number of memory accesses)?
* If no locations available?
