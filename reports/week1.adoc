== Questions

* Since we have a small number of distinct minimizers (compared to the number of possible minimizers (`= 2**(2*k)`)), we could only save (minimizer, position, strand) with minimizer under a certain threshold (to reduce the size of the minimizer array).
* Do we need the `kmerSpan`?
* Does the data structure suits you?
* Which `(k, w)` should I use?
