= Week 12

== TO DO

* Implement the host program
* Take a look at the alignment algorithms
* Use several HBM sections for the FPGA implementation
* Schematic
* Smart partition of the Index
* Test the CPU implementation on the supercomputers
* Solution for reads with variable length
* CPU implementation: translate the reads before

== Achievements

* Use several HBM sections for the FPGA implementation
* Test the CPU implementation on nexus0 (with 60 CPUs)
* Smart partition of the Index for FPGA implementation
