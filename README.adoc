FPGA Genome Indexing &amp; Seeding (Julien Eudine)

== Installation

Clone the repository & build the program:
[source, shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:jeudine/genome_indexing.git
cd genome_indexing && make
----

== Usage

[source, shell]
----
./main -k <k-mer length> -w <window size> -f <frequency threshold> -b <size of the mask> <Genome reference filename (.fna)> <Output binary file>
----

The default values for `k`, `w`, `f` and `b` are 15, 10, 500 and 28 respectively.

Two output binary formats can be generated:

* The default structure consists of 3 arrays. In the first array, each entry corresponds to a minimizer and contains an index of the two other arrays. The two arrays contain the sets of locations & strands corresponding to a given minimizer.
* A sorted array of the following triplet (minimizer, position, strand). Each element is encoded on 72bits. To output this format you have to use the `-r` option.
